Frontend - API Gateway - Backend (Microservices Architecture)
In a microservices-based architecture, an intermediate layer, known as an API Gateway, is introduced between the client-side application (Frontend) and the backend microservices. This API Gateway acts as a centralized entry point for client requests and serves multiple critical functions:

Routing Requests:

Based on the incoming request, the API Gateway determines which microservice is responsible for processing the request and forwards it accordingly.
This decouples the client from having to know the internal structure or endpoints of individual microservices.

Message Validation:

The API Gateway validates incoming requests against predefined schemas (e.g., JSON Schema, OpenAPI specifications).
It ensures that only well-formed and authorized requests reach the backend, reducing load on microservices.

Response Transformation:

The gateway can standardize responses from different microservices to a consistent format before sending them back to the client.
This includes aggregating responses from multiple microservices into a single response when required.

Rate Limiting and Throttling:

To protect backend services from being overwhelmed, the API Gateway enforces rate limits and quotas based on client policies.
This ensures fair usage and prevents abuse by high-frequency requests.

Security and Authentication:

The gateway integrates with authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
It performs token validation and enforces access control before routing requests to the respective services.

Monitoring and Logging:

Centralized logging and metrics collection allow monitoring of API usage and service performance.
Real-time analytics can help in troubleshooting and optimizing the system.

Caching and Optimization:

The gateway can cache frequent or static responses to reduce the load on microservices and improve latency for the client.
It supports compression and other performance enhancements.

Service Discovery:

Dynamic routing based on service discovery ensures that requests are directed to healthy and available instances of a microservice, supporting scalability and fault tolerance.
